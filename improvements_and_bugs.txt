BUGS:

TO DO:
-Fix the flashing messages on login page ("incorrect username or password") before user has signed in
-password encryption
-presigned url requires bucket_name to be a string on .env/config file  but causes all other functions related to S3 : files upload/delete/ display to not work


IMPROVEMENTS: 

Testing:
Complete tests on 
app.route /upload, /login, /delete, /files

S3 Integration with database:
-Integrate S3 with Image class in sql database
-Get presigned_url functions to render correctly 
-enable users to be able to view all of their images (not whole S3 bucket) using sessions
-enable users to delete their images, but not others
-securely upload with presigned_urls 
-change aws persmissions back to private with user access through presigned_urls

Frontend:
-Appeal more to the vaporwave aesthetic: fonts, 90s buttons/windows, purple/pink/turquoise hues, audio?
-add js/jquery/ajax for more responsive pages
-add share/like buttons/comments
